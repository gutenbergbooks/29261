<p><span class = "firstword">Although</span> only the grandson of the
first of his name, the author of the following interesting specimen of
16th-century criticism came of a family of great antiquity, of so great
an antiquity, indeed, as to preclude our tracing it back to its origin.
This family was originally known as the “De Botfelds,” but in the 15th
century one branch adopted the more humble name of “Thynne,” or “of the
Inne.” Why the latter name was first assumed has never been
satisfac&shy;torily explained. It can hardly be supposed that “John de
la Inne de Botfelde,” as he signed himself, kept a veritable hostelry
and sold ale and provender to the travellers between Ludlow and
Shrewsbury, and most probably the term Inn was used in the sense which
has given us “Lincoln’s Inn,” “Gray’s Inn,” or “Furnivall’s Inn,” merely
meaning a place of residence of the higher class, though in this case
inverted, the Inn giving its name to its owner.</p>

<p>However obtained, the name has been borne by the most successful
branch of the De Botfelds down to the present Marquess of Bath, who now
represents it. Much interesting matter connected with the family was
collected by a late descendant of the older branch, Beriah Botfeld, and
published by him in his “Stemmata Botvilliana.”</p>

<p>The first “John of the Inn” married one Jane Bowdler, by whom he had
a son Ralph, who married Anne Hygons, and their son William became clerk
of the kitchen, and according to some, master of the household to Henry
VIII. He
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<a name = "pageiv" id = "pageiv"> </a>
married in the first place a lady who, however she may have advanced her
husband’s prospects at court, behaved in a manner which must have
considerably marred his satisfaction at her success. Those who wish to
study the matrimonial sorrows of “Thynnus Aulicus,” as he calls him, may
consult Erasmus in his Epistolæ, lib. xv. Epist. xiv.</p>

<p>His second marriage to Anne Bond, daughter of William Bond, clerk of
green cloth and master of the household to Henry VIII., was more
fortunate, and by her he had daughters and one son, our Francis
Thynne.</p>

<p>Though his son gives him no higher position in the court of Henry
VIII. than the apparently humble one of clerk of the kitchen, he is
careful to let us know that the post was in reality no mean one, and
that “there were those of good worship both at court and country” who
had at one time been well pleased to be his father’s clerks. That he was
a man of superior mind there is no question, and we have a pleasant hint
in the following tract of his intimacy with his king, and of their
mutual fondness for literature. To William Thynne, indeed, all who read
the English language are deeply indebted, for to his industry and love
for his author we owe much of what we now possess of Chaucer. Another
curious bit of literary gossip to be gleaned from this tract is that
William Thynne was a patron and supporter of John Skelton, who was an
inmate of his house at Erith, whilst composing that most masterly bit of
bitter truth, his “Colin Clout,” a&nbsp;satire perhaps unsurpassed in
our language.</p>

<p>William Thynne rests beside his second wife, in the church of
Allhallows, Barking, near the Tower of London, where there are two
handsome brasses to their memory. That of William Thynne represents him
in full armour with a tremendous dudgeon dagger and broadsword, most
warlike guize for a clerk of the kitchen and editor of Chaucer. The
dress of his wife is quite refreshing in its graceful comeliness
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<a name = "pagev" id = "pagev"> </a>
in these days of revived “farthingales and hoops.” These brasses were
restored by the late Marquess of Bath. Would that the same good feeling
for things old had prevented the owners of the “church property” from
casing the old tower with a hideous warehouse.</p>

<p>The Sir John Thynne mentioned in the “Animadversions” was most
probably a cousin of Francis. He married the daughter of Sir Thomas
Gresham, the builder of the Royal Exchange, part of whose wealth was
devoted by his son-in-law to the building of the beautiful family seat
of Long Leat, in Wiltshire, in which work he was doubtless aided
indirectly by the Reformation, for, says the old couplet,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Portman, Horner, Popham, and Thynne,</p>
<p>When the monks went out they came in.”</p>
</div>

<p>Francis Thynne was born in Kent, probably at his father’s house at
Erith, about 1550. He was educated at Tunbridge school under learned
Master Proctor, thence to Magdalen College, Oxford, and then, as the
manner was, to the Inns of Court, where he lay at Lincoln’s Inn for a
while. Some men are born antiquarians as others are born poets, and we
may be pretty certain that it was at Thynne’s own desire that his court
influence was used to procure him the post of “Blanch Lyon pursuivant,”
a&nbsp;position which would enable him to pursue studies, the results of
which, however valuable in themselves, but seldom prove capable of being
converted into the vulgar necessities of food and raiment. Poor John
Stowe, with his license to beg, as the reward of the labour of his life,
is a terrible proof of how utterly unmarketable a valuable commodity may
become.</p>

<p>Leading a calm and quiet life in the pleasant villages of Poplar and
Clerkenwell, in “sweet and studious idleness,” as he himself calls it,
the old herald was enabled to accumulate rich stores of matter, much of
which has come down to
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "pagevi" id = "pagevi"> </a>
us, principally in manuscript, scattered through various great
libraries, which prove him to have deserved Camden’s estimate of him as
“an antiquary of great judgment and diligence.” It would seem that he
had entertained the idea of following in his father’s footsteps, and of
becoming an editor of Chaucer, and that he had even made some
collections towards that end. The appearance of Speight’s edition
probably prevented this idea being carried out, and the evident soreness
exhibited in this little tract very probably arose from a feeling that
his friend had rather unfairly stolen a march upon him. However the
wound was not deep, and Speight made use of Thynne’s corrections, and
Thynne assisted Speight, in new editions, with all friendship and
sympathy.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> I&nbsp;suspect him of dabbling in alchemy and the occult
sciences. He shows himself well acquainted with the terms peculiar to
those mysteries, and hints that Chaucer only “enveyed” against the
“sophisticall abuse,” not the honest use of the Arcana. Moreover in the
British Museum (MS.&nbsp;add. 11,388) there is a volume containing much
curious matter collected by him on these subjects, and not only
collected
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
<a name = "pagevii" id = "pagevii"> </a>
but illustrated by him with most gorgeous colours and wondrous drawing,
worthy of the blazonry of a Lancaster Herald. The costumes however are
carefully correct, and give us useful hints as to the fashion of the
raiment of our ancestors. From the peculiar piety and earnestness (most
important elements in the search for the philosopher’s stone), of the
small “signs” and prayers appended to these papers, it is, I&nbsp;think,
clear, that he was working in all good faith and belief. Possibly the
following lines, which seem to have been his favourite motto, may have
been inspired by the disappoint&shy;ment and dyspepsia produced by his
smoky studies and their ill success,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“My strange and froward fate</p>
<p class = "indent">Shall turn her whele anew</p>
<p>To better or to payre my fate,</p>
<p class = "indent">Which envy dothe pursue.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 22nd of April, 1602, he was with great ceremony advanced to
the honour of Lancaster Herald. He never surrendered his patent, and as
his successor entered on that post in November, 1608, he is supposed to
have died about that date, though some postpone his death till 1611. He
married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas de la Rivers of
Bransbe, but left no issue.</p>

<p>There are many points of interest to be picked out of the following
honest and straight&shy;forward bit of criticism, if we examine it
closely: and, firstly, as to its author? Is there not something very
character&shy;istic in its general tone, something dimly sketching a
shadowy outline of a kindly, fussy, busy, querulous old man, much given
to tiny minutiæ, a&nbsp;careful copier with a clean pen, <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">indefa&shy;tiguable</ins> in
collecting “contributions” to minor history; one jealous of all
appearance of slight to his office, even to being moved to wrath with
Master Speight for printing “Harolds” instead of “Harlotts,” and letting
him know how mightily a “Harold” like himself
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
<a name = "pageviii" id = "pageviii"> </a>
would be offended at being holden of the condition of so base a thing as
False Semblance? Perhaps the more so from a half-consciousness that the
glory of the office was declining, and that if the smallest opening were
given, a&nbsp;ribald wit might create terrible <ins class = "correction"
title = "spelling unchanged">havock</ins> amongst his darling idols. How
delicately he snubs Master Speight for not calling on him at Clerkenwell
Green (How would Speight have travelled the distance in 1598? It was a
long uphill walk for an antiquarian, and the fields by no means safe
from long-staff sixpenny strikers); and how modestly he hints that he
would have derived no “disparagement” from so doing; showing all the
devotion to little matters of etiquette of an amiable but irritable old
gentleman of our own day.</p>

<p>But mark this old gentleman’s description of his father’s collection
of Chaucer’s MS.! Had ever a Bibliophile a more delightful commission
than that one of William Thynne’s, empowering him to rout and to rummage
amongst all the monasteries and libraries of England in search of the
precious fragments? And had ever a Bibliophile a greater reward for his
pleasant toils? “Fully furnished with a multitude of books, emongst
which one coppye of some part of his works subscribed in various places
‘Examinatur Chaucer’!” Where is this invaluable MS. now? It is worth the
tracing, if it be possible, even to its intermediate history. Was it one
of those stolen from Francis Thynne’s house at Poplar by that
biblio&shy;maniacal burglar? or was it one of those which in a fit of
generosity, worthy of those heroic times, he gave to Stephen Batemann,
that most fortunate parson of Newington? Is this commission to be
regarded as some slight proof that the spoliation of the monasteries was
not carried on with the reckless Vandalism usually attributed to the
reformers?</p>

<p>We learn from this tract that William Thynne left no less than
twenty-five copies of Chaucerian MS. to his son, doubtless but a small
tything of the entire number extant, showing that
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<a name = "pageix" id = "pageix"> </a>
there were men amongst the monks who could enjoy wit and humour even
when directed against themselves, and that there must have been some
considerable liberality if not laxness of rule amongst the orders of the
day. It would, I&nbsp;fancy, be difficult to find amongst the monkeries
of our own time (except possibly those belonging to that very cheery
order the Capuchines) an abbot inclined to permit his monks to read,
much less to copy, so heretical a work as the Canterbury Tales, however
freely he winked at the introduction of French nouvellettes.</p>

<p>But though some may have enjoyed Chaucer in all good faith, there
were others who saw how trenchant were the blows he dealt against the
churchmen of his time, and what deadly mischief to their pre-eminence
lurked under his seeming <i>bonhommie</i>. Wolsey thought it worth his
while to exert his influence against him so strongly as to oblige
William Thynne to alter his plan of publication, though backed by the
promised protection of Henry VIII. And the curious action of the
Parliament noticed in the tract (<a href = "#page7">p.&nbsp;7</a>) was
doubtless owing to the same influence:<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id
= "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> an assumption of the right of censure by
the Parliament which seems to have gone near to deprive us of Chaucer
altogether. The Parliament men were right in regarding the works of
Chaucer as mere fables, but they forgot that fables have “morals,” and
that these morals were directed to the decision of the great question of
whether the “spiritual” or the “temporal” man was to rule the world,
a&nbsp;question unhappily not quite settled even in our own time.</p>

<p>The notice of that other sturdy reformer, John Skelton
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "pagex" id = "pagex"> </a>
(<a href = "#page7">p.&nbsp;7</a>) is also very interesting, and gives
us a hint of the existence of a “protesting” feeling in the Court of
Henry VIII. before there was any reason for attributing it to mere
private or political motives. From the way in which it is mentioned
here, I&nbsp;suspect that the more general satire “Colin Clout” preceded
the more directly personal one of “Why come ye nat to court?” which
lashes Wolsey himself with a heartily outspoken virulence which would
hardly have been tolerated by him when in the zenith of his power. It
was not improbably written whilst its author was safe in sanctuary under
Bishop Islip. William Thynne, court favourite though he was, could never
have kept Skelton’s head on his shoulders after so terrible a
provocation.</p>

<p>Wherever he may be placed, John Skelton stands alone amongst
satirists, there is no one like him: possibly from a feeling that he was
writing on the winning side, and sure of sympathy and protection, he
scorns to hide his pearls under a dunghill like Rabelais, and utters
fearlessly and openly what he has to say. Even in our own time,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Though his rime be ragged</p>
<p>Tattered and iagged</p>
<p>Rudely rain-beaten</p>
<p>Rusty and moth-eaten</p>
<p><i>If ye talke well therewyth</i></p>
<p><i>Yt hath in it some pith</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thynne’s note on the family of Gower (<a href = "#page14">p. 14</a>)
is of value as agreeing with later theories, which deny that Gower the
poet was of the Gowers of Stittenham, the ancestors of the present
houses of Sutherland and Ellesmere. The question is not, however,
finally decided, and we have reason to believe that all the Gowers of
Great Britain are descended from the same family of Guers still
flourishing in Brittany. Early coat-armours are not much to be depended
on, and Thynne as a Herald may lean a little too much towards them. The
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
question is, however, in good hands, and I hope that before long some
fresh light may be thrown upon&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The old story of Chaucer’s having been fined for beating a Franciscan
friar in Fleet Street is doubted by Thynne, though hardly, I&nbsp;think,
on sufficient grounds. Tradition (when it agrees with our own views) is
not lightly to be disturbed, and remembering with what more than
feminine powers of invective “spiritual” men seem to be not unfrequently
endowed, and also how atrociously insolent a Franciscan friar would be
likely to be (of&nbsp;course from the best motives) to a man like
Chaucer, who had burnt into the very soul of monasticism with the
caustic of his wit, I&nbsp;shall continue to believe the legend for the
present. If the mediæval Italians are to be believed, the cudgelling of
a friar was occasionally thought necessary even by the most faithful,
and I see no reason why hale Dan Chaucer should not have lost his temper
on sufficient provocation. Old men have hot blood sometimes, and Dickens
does not outrage probability when he makes Martin <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Chuzzelwit</ins> the elder,
fell Mr Pecksniff to the ground.</p>

<p>Much of the tract is taken up by corrections of etymologies, and the
explanation of obscure and obsolete words. It is a little curious that
the word “orfrayes,” which had gone so far out of date as to be
unintel&shy;ligible to Master Speight, should, thanks to the new rage
for church and clergy decoration, have become reasonably common again.
The note on the “Vernacle” is another bit of close and accurate
antiquarian knowledge worth noting. It is most tantalizing that after
all he says about that mysterious question of “The Lords son of
Windsor,” a&nbsp;question as mysterious as that demanding why <ins class
= "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Falstalf</ins> likened
Prince Henry’s father to a “singing man” of the same place, we should be
left as wise as we were before. We have here and there, too, hints as to
what we have lost from Thynne’s great
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
storehouse of information; how valuable would have been “that long and
no common discourse” which he tells us he might have composed on that
most curious form of judicial knavery, the ordeal; and possibly much
more so is that of his “collections” for his edition of Chaucer! This
last may, however, be still recovered by some fortunate literary
mole.</p>

<p>The notice, by no means clear, but certainly not complimentary, of
“the second editione to one inferior personne, than my father’s editione
was,” may refer to any of the editions of Chaucer which, according to
Lowndes, were printed more or less from William Thynne’s edition in
1542, 1546, and 1555; but from another passage hinting that Speight
followed “a&nbsp;late English corrector whom I forbear to name,”
I&nbsp;suspect that the “inferior personne” was poor John Stowe, and the
edition to have been that edited by him in 1561, the nearest in point of
date to that of Speight.</p>

<p>The manuscript from which this tract is reprinted is, like most of
the treasures of the Bridgewater Library, wonderfully clean and in good
order. It is entirely in the Autograph of Francis Thynne, and was
evidently written purposely for the great Lord Chancellor Egerton, and
bears his arms emblazoned on the title-page. Master Speight most
probably got <i>his</i> copy of Animad&shy;versions in a more humble
form.</p>

<p>In conclusion may I remark that, as usual, the green silk ribands,
originally attached to the vellum and gold cover, are closely cut away,
probably for the purpose of being converted into shoe-ties, which Robert
Green informs us was the usual destination of those appended to
presentation copies, hinting at the same time that they were generally
the only solid advantage gained by the dedicatee from the honour done
him.</p>

“To the readers. After this booke was last printed, I&nbsp;understand
that M.&nbsp;Francis Thynn had a purpose, as indeed he hath when the
time shall serve, to set out Chaucer with a coment in our tongue, as the
Italians have Petrarke and others in their language. Whereupon I
purposed not to meddle any further in this work, although some promise
made to the contrarie, but to referre all to him; being a gentleman for
that purpose inferior to none, both in regard to his own skill, as also
of those helps left to him by his father. Yet notwith&shy;standing,
Chaucer now being printed againe I was willing not only to helpe some
imperfections, but also to add some things whereunto he did not only
persuade me, but most kindly lent me his helpe and direction. By this
means most of his old words are restored: proverbes and sentences
marked: such Notes as were collected, drawne into better order and the
text by olde copies corrected.” Speight’s Chaucer, 1602.</p>

Urry, in his Ed. of Chaucer, says that the Canterbury Tales were exempt
from the prohibition of the Act of 34 Henry VIII. “For the advancement
of true religion.” I&nbsp;find no notice of this in the Act in the
“Statutes at large,” 1763. He also refers to Foxe’s Acts and Monuments,
which is also merely negative on the subject.</p>

Fo: 1. pa: 2. For Campaneus you wolde reade Capaneus, wherunto I cannott
yelde. for althoughe Statius and other latine authors do call hym
Capaneus; yet all the writers of Englande in that age call him
campaneus; as Gower, in confessione amantis, and Lidgat in the historye
of Thebes taken <ins class = "spell" title = "oute">out</ins> of
Statius, and Chaucer hym selfe in many other places. so that yt semethe
they made the pronu<i>n</i>tiatione of Campaneus to be the dialecte of
our tongue for Capaneus. Besides chaucer is in this to be
